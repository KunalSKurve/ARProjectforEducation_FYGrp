# Unity Based Application that uses Augmented Reality for Education

SYNOPSIS

IMPORTANCE OF THE  DECIDED PROJECT  		
The project will not only revolutionize education methodology but also military operations and bring transformation in the field of inspection. It will minimize the time required for making maps for each working area. A better perspective of the field location without actually going on ground.


STEPS TO DO THE PROJECT/ METHODOLOGY..(components, circuit, how will you design the project model )
1. Learning all about Augmented Reality (A.R.) ,height maps,Unity and Vuforia.
2. Processing on a height map to convert it into a 3D model map.
3. Creating a Card with markers to act as a plane for the 3D model.
4. Creating the main Application to place the 3D map on the ground with the help of markers.
5. The main application will be a Camera with Augmented Reality features of stabilising the 3D map with respect to ground or specially designed card .
6. Post processing on the map renders and optimises the performance of the application.



TENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS / OUTCOME FROM THE PROJECT  
Successful working of the AR application. Ease of surveillance for Army and implementations of Augmented Reality in the field of defence and military operations.
